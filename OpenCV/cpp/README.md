Team, this is a c++ program that opens up an image and 
displays it in a window. The image will have its face and eyes circled. 
Be sure you load a real image from your local hard-drive. 

For now, you must follow the tutorial here.

https://www.opencv-srf.com/2017/11/install-opencv-with-visual-studio.html

In the tutorial, whenever you see ......v14..... (in the things you have to past in Visual Studio)
change the v14 to v15. 

When asked to paste opencv_world331 replace the 331 with 411. 
Itll look like opencv_world411d.lib and opencv_world411.lib (there are two times you must do this)


Slack me if you need any help! 

Be sure to restart Visual Studio after completing the tutorial.

For the main program, copy the main.cpp program into the editor!
